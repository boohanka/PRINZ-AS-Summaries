### `AS-1-Underlying-Starts.R`

Cleans raw data file `app-underlying-data-app-starts-202324-q1.csv` in this sequence:

- Removes unneeded columns and missing AS.
- Aggregates to *quarterly* time frequency.
- Aggregates to *TTWA* geography.

#### Notes 

1. Assumes LAD 2015 geography for AS starts.
2. Multiplies starts by LAD shares.

### `AS-2-Skills Starts.R`

**Disaggregates** AS starts to AS Skills starts by **joining AS descriptions** to AS starts.

#### Notes 

42 AS that are in starts are not in the current classification mostly because they've been discontinued. 50 are in classification but are not in starts.

### `AS-3-Imputing Zero Values.R`

Some **geographies have no starts** in a given period, so impute zeroes for different classifications only. This results in 13020 - 8922 = 4098 additional zero observations.
