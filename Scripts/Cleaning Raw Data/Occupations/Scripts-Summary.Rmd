### `SOC-1-Sample Selection.R`

- Upload 4-digit SOC codes from `Data/Raw/Occupations/UKSOC Codes.xlsx`.
- Generate 3-digit codes and join a crosswalk of 3 digit Minor classifications from `https://www.hesa.ac.uk/collection/coding-manual-tools/sicsocdata/soc-2010#five-digit`.
- Join the AS SOC codes and generate flags for potential qualifiers in the sample:
  1. All occupations that are part of 3-digit Minor groups that appear in LC AS.
  2. All occupations whose SOC code does not begin with 1 or 2.
  3. All occupations in the sectors that appear in LC AS.
  
#### Notes

Approaches 1, 2, 3 give 100, 262, 58 4-digit occupations, respectively, out of 369 total.

### `SOC-2-LFS Weights.R`

Creates and exports the distribution of occupations started 2015-2020. The steps involve:

- Filtering the observations that started employment in the periods 2015-2017 and 2018-2020 and are *still employed* during the survey (cannot be the case that employment is started in 2015 and ended shortly after, for example).
- Group by SOC3D and sum weights. 
- Normalise the weights for each period, creating a distribution of difference 3 digit occupations.
- Create average weight summarising information on both periods.


#### Notes

All observations that have -8 (No Answer) or -9 (N/A) in occupation codes are removed. Average weight between the two periods is calculated as simple *mean of the weights*.

### `SOC-3-Combining Occupation Info.R`

In addition to the different flags, add **education requirements** and the **LFS weights** to the occupations from `SOC-1-Sample Selection.R`.

- Add education requirements from `Data/Raw/Occupations/UKSOC Education Requirements.xlsx`, flagging those SOC codes that require a PhD or Level 6.
- Join the LFS weights from `SOC-2-LFS Weights.R` at 3 digit level.
