### `SOC-1-Sample Selection.R`

- Upload 4-digit SOC codes from `Data/Raw/Occupations/UKSOC Codes.xlsx`.
- Generate 3-digit codes and join a crosswalk of 3 digit Minor classifications from `https://www.hesa.ac.uk/collection/coding-manual-tools/sicsocdata/soc-2010#five-digit`.
- Join the AS SOC codes and generate flags for potential qualifiers in the sample:
  1. All occupations that are part of 3-digit Minor groups that appear in LC AS.
  2. All occupations whose SOC code does not begin with 1 or 2.
  3. All occupations in the sectors that appear in LC AS.
  
#### Notes

Approaches 1, 2, 3 give 100, 262, 58 4-digit occupations, respectively, out of 369 total.

### `SOC-2-Education Requirements.R`

Add education requirements from `Data/Raw/Occupations/UKSOC Education Requirements.xlsx`, flagging those SOC codes that require a PhD or Level 6.
